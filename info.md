# v0.2.6

## 💡 New Features

All alarm devices now have "debug" button entities. These are diagnostic buttons that, when pressed, dump technical data into Home Assistant's main log. This makes it easier to report issues to developers.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

Added error logging for some login and update failures.
