# v0.2.5-hotfix.1

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

1. Fixes bug in which locks always report locked state. ([#113](https://github.com/uvjustin/alarmdotcom/issues/113))
2. Added button sub-entities to each Alarm.com component. These buttons let users easily dump entity data to the Home Assistant log, reducing friction when reporting issues to developers.

## 🧹 Housekeeping

Improved code linting to close gap that allowed [#113](https://github.com/uvjustin/alarmdotcom/issues/113) to make it into production.
